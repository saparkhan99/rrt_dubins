# rrt_dubins
The files that consist of the code that create the shortest path from start to goal position using Dubins-Based RRT* algorithm with random angles of going into the nodes.

path_finder.py - creates dubins-based paths and stops running after the first path is created.

path_with_robot.py - creates the path and show the movement of the animated car along the generated path.

paths_many.py - creates multiple paths, compares their distance and chooses the snallest one.
